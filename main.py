'''
What Is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
    Structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are 
    bundled into individual objects.

    Example:
        An object could represent a person with a name property,
        age, address, etc., and behaviors like adding 
        attachments and sending.

Classes in Python:
    - Each thing or object is an instance of some class.
    - The primitive data structures available in Python, like numbers, 
      strings, and lists.
    
    What if you wanted to represent something much more complicated?

    Example:
        Let’s say you wanted to track a number of different communication node.
        If we use a list, the first element could be the nodes IP address while 
            the second element could represent its MAC address.
        How would we know which element is supposed to be which?
        What if you had 100 different nodes? 
    
    Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain 
        arbitrary information about something.

    Example:
        In the case of an communication node, we could create an Node() class 
            to track properties about the Node like the IP and MAC addresses.

    
    It’s important to note that a class just provides structure.
    It’s a blueprint for how something should be defined.
